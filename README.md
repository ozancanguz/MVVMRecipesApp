# MVVMRecipesApp
// I have built a recipe app. Basicly there are list of recipes.
// There are 3 screens.
// First one is recipe screen where all the recipe listed from https://spoonacular.com/food-api/.
// Second one is Favorite recipes. We can save favorite recipe and list in favorite screen.
// We can save it on our local phone with offline caching.
// Third one is foodjoke screnn. Everytime we refresh the page , new food joke will be on the screnn.
